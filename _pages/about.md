My name is Xiaohang Sun. I am a first-year PhD student in Political Science at Penn State. I study political economy and authoritarian politics. Before joining Penn State, I earned dual bachelor’s degrees in international politics and economics from Shandong University, China, in 2024. I then pursued a master’s degree in international relations at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My undergraduate and master’s theses examine, respectively, Chinese outward FDI and FDI in China, analyzing how multinational corporations factor politics into their investment decisions.
